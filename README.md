# Animal Safari Board Game

Players take turns rolling the die & moving the number of spaces indicated on the die. If a player lands on a compass space, they must draw a card & follow the directions given. If a player lands on a binoculars space, they must draw a card from the deck of animal cards. The first player to collect five animal cards & reach the finish space wins the game.

NOTE: Add values on the bottom row to values in the left column to get player position!
